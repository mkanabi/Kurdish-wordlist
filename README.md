# Kurdish Wordlist

Welcome to the Kurdish Wordlist repository! This repository is a continuous work in progress dedicated to the collection, categorization, and filtering of Kurdish words. It aims to provide developers with a comprehensive resource of Kurdish language data that they can utilize in their projects.

## About the Wordlist

The Kurdish Wordlist is an ongoing project where I am actively collecting and curating a diverse range of Kurdish words. The wordlist includes words from various Kurdish dialects and covers different parts of speech, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and more. The primary objective is to create a valuable linguistic resource for developers and researchers interested in the Kurdish language.

## Contributions

Contributions to the Kurdish Wordlist are highly encouraged and appreciated. If you have additional Kurdish words or improvements to existing entries, please feel free to submit a pull request. By contributing, you help enrich the wordlist and make it more useful for the community.

## Usage

The Kurdish Wordlist can be utilized in a variety of projects, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, language learning applications, and more. Developers can leverage the wordlist for tasks such as text analysis, language generation, spell checking, and vocabulary enrichment. Please refer to the license section below for the terms of use.

## Game: Wishasaz

I have also created a game called Wishasaz using the Kurdish Wordlist. Wishasaz is a word-based game where players have to guess and arrange letters to form valid Kurdish words. It's a fun and educational game that can help improve vocabulary and language skills.

You can play the game [here](https://kanabi.me/wishasaz/play.html).

Feel free to check it out and enjoy playing with the words from the Kurdish Wordlist!
