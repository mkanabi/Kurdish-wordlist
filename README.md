# Kurdish Wordlist

Welcome to the Kurdish Wordlist repository! This repository is a continuous work in progress dedicated to the collection, categorization, and filtering of Kurdish words. It aims to provide developers with a comprehensive resource of Kurdish language data that they can utilize in their projects.

## About the Wordlist

The Kurdish Wordlist is an ongoing project where I am actively collecting and curating a diverse range of Kurdish words. The wordlist includes words from various Kurdish dialects and covers different parts of speech, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and more. The primary objective is to create a valuable linguistic resource for developers and researchers interested in the Kurdish language.

## Contributions

Contributions to the Kurdish Wordlist are highly encouraged and appreciated. If you have additional Kurdish words or improvements to existing entries, please feel free to submit a pull request. By contributing, you help enrich the wordlist and make it more useful for the community.

## Organization and Structure

The wordlist is organized alphabetically and categorized by parts of speech. Each word entry includes the word itself, its part of speech, and any relevant additional information. The wordlist is provided in a plain text format for easy integration into different projects. Additionally, the wordlist will be periodically updated as new words are collected and verified.

## Usage

The Kurdish Wordlist can be utilized in a variety of projects, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, language learning applications, and more. Developers can leverage the wordlist for tasks such as text analysis, language generation, spell checking, and vocabulary enrichment. Please refer to the license section below for the terms of use.
